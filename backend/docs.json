    "content": "Users can reset their password by navigating to Settings > Security > Reset Password. Click on 'Forgot Password' and enter your registered email address. You will receive a password reset link via email within 5 minutes. The link expires after 24 hours for security reasons. If you don't receive the email, check your spam folder or request a new link. For security, you cannot reuse your last 5 passwords. If you're locked out after multiple failed attempts, wait 30 minutes or contact support. Password reset links can only be used once and become invalid after use. Make sure to create a strong password with at least 8 characters including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters."

    "content": "To create a new account, visit the signup page and provide your full name, email address, and a strong password. Passwords must be at least 8 characters long and contain uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. After registration, verify your email by clicking the link sent to your inbox. The verification link expires in 48 hours. You must be at least 13 years old to create an account. Each email address can only be used for one account. If you already have an account with that email, you'll need to reset your password instead. During signup, you can optionally add a profile picture and phone number. Your account will be created immediately but certain features require email verification. We do not share your personal information with third parties without consent."

The export includes all your profile information, activity history, uploaded files, messages, and settings. Large exports may take up to 24 hours to process and will be sent via email as a downloadable link. The download link expires after 7 days for security. JSON format is best for developers and includes all metadata. CSV format works well with spreadsheet applications. PDF format is human-readable and suitable for archiving. You can request exports once per day. Exports are encrypted and password-protected. The file size limit for exports is 5GB - larger datasets will be split into multiple files. You can also schedule automatic monthly exports."

    "title": "Two-Factor Authentication",
    "content": "Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security method that requires two different forms of verification to access your account. Enable 2FA for enhanced security by going to Settings > Security > Two-Factor Authentication. The first factor is your password, and the second factor can be a code sent via SMS, generated by an authenticator app, or a hardware security key. You can use SMS codes sent to your phone, authenticator apps like Google Authenticator or Authy, or physical hardware security keys like YubiKey. Backup codes are provided during setup - save these in a secure location in case you lose access to your 2FA device. Each backup code can only be used once. You'll need to enter your 2FA code every time you log in from a new device. Trusted devices can be remembered for 30 days. If you lose your 2FA device, use a backup code or contact support with identity verification. 2FA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized account access even if your password is compromised."

Use Bearer token authentication for all requests by including your API key in the Authorization header. API keys can be scoped with specific permissions like read-only or write access.
